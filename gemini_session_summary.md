## Summary of Changes

This session focused on two main tasks: updating the language localization and adding product management features.

### 1. Language Localization Update

*   **Replaced Hausa with French:** The language switcher was updated to toggle between English and French instead of English and Hausa.
*   **Updated Translations:** The hardcoded translations in `LanguageContext.js` were updated to French.
*   **Button Text:** The language switcher button text was updated to reflect the change to French.

### 2. Product Management and Availability

*   **Admin Panel:** An admin panel was created at the `/admin` route to manage products.
*   **CRUD Functionality:** The admin panel allows for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting products stored in Firebase.
*   **Firebase Functions:** New functions were added to `firebaseSearch.js` to handle the product CRUD operations.
*   **Product Availability:** The home page was updated to display a list of products with their stock availability.
*   **Out of Stock Indicator:** Products that are out of stock are now indicated, and the "Order" button is disabled for those items.
